Jetzt Anders! was an Austrian band, put together by the Austrian casting show Starmania. Their music style is a mix of soul, pop and rock. They wanted to call the band Jetzt! ("Now!"), but there were already two other bands in Austria with that name, so they called the band Jetzt Anders! ("Now Different!"). Band member Tom Neuwirth would go on to win the Eurovision Song Contest 2014 as his drag persona Conchita Wurst.
